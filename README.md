# Online Satisfaction Management System (OSMS)

This repository contains the code for an Online Satisfaction Management System (OSMS), a web application designed to gather and manage user satisfaction data. The application is built using PHP and interacts with a MySQL database.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: The application includes robust user authentication features, with scripts for checking login status and user roles.

- **Contact Form**: Users can submit inquiries through a contact form. The submitted inquiries are stored in the `inquiries` table in the database, allowing for easy tracking and management of user feedback.

- **User Profile**: The application supports user profile pictures, displaying a default image if a user-specific image is not found.

- **Styling**: The application uses external CSS for styling and Google Fonts and Font Awesome for typography and icons, resulting in a clean and modern user interface.

## Purpose

The OSMS is designed with a focus on user satisfaction. It provides features for users to express their satisfaction level and for administrators to manage and respond to these inputs. This makes it a valuable tool for any organization looking to improve their service based on user feedback.
